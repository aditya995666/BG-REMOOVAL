# Background Removal  – Project Description

# Overview

The Background Removal API is a Flask-based web service that processes uploaded images and automatically removes their background. It leverages the Rembg library with deep learning models to separate the foreground subject from the background. The processed image is then placed on a white background and returned as a downloadable URL.

# Key Features

API Endpoint

remove-bg → Accepts image uploads via POST request.

Returns a processed image URL with the background removed.

Image Processing

Uses PIL (Pillow) for handling and converting images.

Applies Rembg for AI-powered background removal.

Automatically converts final images to JPEG format with a white background.

Output Handling

Processed images are saved inside the static/processed_images folder.

Returns a public URL so users can access/download the result easily.

Error Handling

Detects if no image is uploaded or filename is empty.

Handles unexpected runtime errors and returns meaningful error messages.

Deployment Ready

Configured for platforms like Render.com, Heroku, or Docker.

Supports dynamic port binding ($PORT environment variable).

 Project Workflow

User sends an image file via POST request to /remove-bg.

API loads the image and converts it to RGBA format.

Background is removed using AI-based segmentation (Rembg).

A white background is added, and image is converted back to RGB.

Final processed image is saved in the server’s static/processed_images folder.

API responds with a direct URL for accessing the processed image.

Use Cases

E-commerce: Product photo editing for clean white backgrounds.

 Media/Design: Quick removal of image backgrounds for content creation.

 Developers: Integrating automated background removal into larger applications.

 Students: Learning about computer vision, AI, and image processing.

# Tech Stack
